        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>My name is Mikias Abate, and I am a student in the Information Systems Department at Addis Ababa University. I have a passion for web development, particularly using Django and Python.</p>
        <p>During my time at Addis Ababa University, I have gained a deep understanding of various computer science and programming concepts, including search algorithms, machine learning, database development, and web development. I have also honed my skills in programming languages such as C#, Prolog, C++, Python, and Java.</p>
        <p>My experience with Django has been particularly rewarding. I find its strength, high performance, security features, and ease of use to be unmatched. I have completed a Python course and received a certificate from Simplilearn, further enhancing my skills in web development.</p>
        <p>Outside of my academic and professional pursuits, I am interested in economics, focusing on topics such as oligopoly, monopolistic competition, perfect competition, and consumer theory. I am also fascinated by the design and implementation of databases, especially in optimizing their performance.</p>
        <p>Overall, I am a dedicated and enthusiastic individual with a strong passion for technology and a drive to continuously learn and improve my skills in the field of information systems and web development.</p>
